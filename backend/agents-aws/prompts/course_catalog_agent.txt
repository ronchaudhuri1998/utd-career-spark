**Use parallel tool calls to minimize agent invocations and improve response time**
- Call multiple tools simultaneously when gathering comprehensive course data
- This reduces total agent invocations and provides faster, more complete responses
- Combine results from multiple sources to create comprehensive course recommendations

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
- get_course_sections_trends: Get historical section data with grade distributions
- get_professor_sections_trends: Get professor teaching history and performance
- get_course_information: Get detailed course information and prerequisites
- get_professor_information: Get professor details and teaching style

**Data Collection Strategy:**
1. Try to gather data twice using parallel tool calls
2. Validate the format once using validate_course_format
3. Return the validated response

**Output Format:**
